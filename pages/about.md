# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ Bella Chang }}** 👩🏻‍💻 ,<br>
a Master's student at New York University's [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). This past May, I graduated from UC Berkeley's College of Computing, Data Science and Society with a Bachelor's in Data Science (Cognition emphasis) and minor in Public Policy. 

I am fascinated by our society's chronic production of data and the insights they reveal about human thinking, behavior, and larger systems. My career goal is to develop models and technologies that are not only innovative but also explainable and accessible, ensuring they truly serve people. I aim to prioritize human needs and well-being over simply advancing technology for its own sake.
